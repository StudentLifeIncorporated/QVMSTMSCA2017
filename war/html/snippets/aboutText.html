The Dulles High School TMSCA Tournament is a competition hosted annually by the Dulles Math and Science Club. 
The tournament offers students from 6th grade to 12th grade the opportunity to measure their skills in Number Sense, Calculator, Math and Science against those of their peers. 
Prizes are awarded to top placing students in a variety of categories and schools in the sweepstakes. 
Our tournament administers TMSCA Test #9 to middle school students and Test #10 to high school students. 
For lunch, schools may purchase boxes of pizza. 
For individual students, snacks including drinks, chips, and candy, are available for purchase. 
Parents, students, and coaches are encouraged to help expedite test grading in the library.
